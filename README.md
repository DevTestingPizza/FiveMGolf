# FiveMGolf
A FiveM golf minigame.


This is not a working minigame, this is just some of the testing code that I ended up with while doing research.
Im not sure if everything that i discovered made it in here, but at least this is all the code that I could find so far (after about 6-8 months of no longer working on it).

I'm releasing this, hoping that someone finds it useful and continues research on golf natives in GTA V.
If you use any of this code from this repo, please link this repository for others to use this as the base for their research.
